# What does this do?
* Automatically inserts [UTM tags](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/) to all links
When you use analytics software, you often get flucuations in views. Let's say you get 200 views in one hour. With UTM, they'll know those views came from me. Without UTM, they'll just see "email". The idea is hopefully it'll get me noticed to a lot of other people. Kinda like a marketting channel.
* Spell checks the contents
* Double checks to make sure all links are ok and non 404
